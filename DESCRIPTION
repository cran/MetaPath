Description: Perform the Meta-analysis for Pathway Enrichment (MAPE) 
		methods introduced by Shen and Tseng (2010). It includes functions to
        automatically perform MAPE_G (integrating multiple studies at
        gene level), MAPE_P (integrating multiple studies at pathway
        level) and MAPE_I (a hybrid method integrating MAEP_G and
        MAPE_P methods). In the simulation and real data analyses in
        the paper, MAPE_G and MAPE_P have complementary advantages and
        detection power depending on the data structure. In general,
        the integrative form of MAPE_I is recommended to use. In the
        case that MAPE_G (or MAPE_P) detects almost none pathway, the
        integrative MAPE_I does not improve performance and MAPE_P (or
        MAPE_G) should be used. Reference: Shen, Kui, and George C
